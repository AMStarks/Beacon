Weeks after Andrew Hastie threatened to quit the frontbench if the Coalition embraced net zero, three high-profile current and former senior Liberal women have warned going backwards on climate action will only hurt the party more with key demographics. Maria Kovacic, recently promoted to Sussan Ley's shadow ministry, said women and young people had already abandoned the party at the last election."
